# RunGPT

Amplifying GPT's capabilities by giving it access to **locally executed plugins**.

Why? So you can control what GPT should have access to: Access to parts of the local filesystem, allow it to access the internet, give it a docker container to use.

Imagine Auto-GPT, MemoryGPT, BabyAGI & co could all be plugins for RunGPT, too, providing their capabilities and more together under one common framework.

Basically a locally run proxy to the OpenAI API with a plugin system and its own locally served chat UI.
